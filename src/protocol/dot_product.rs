/// This protocol is an extension of the CHIKP multiplication protocol described in the paper:
/// "High-Throughput Secure AES Computation" (High-throughput secure AES computation. In WAHC@CCS 2018, pp. 13â€“24, 2018)
/// by Koji Chida, Koki Hamada, Dai Ikarashi, Ryo Kikuchi and Benny Pinkas
/// <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3267973.3267977>
///
/// The extension allows for the computation of the sum of multiple multiplications (in other words, a dot-product operation)
/// at the communication cost of a single multiplication.
///
/// This extension is summarized in the paper:
/// "Fast Large-Scale Honest-Majority MPC for Malicious Adversaries"
/// by Koji Chida, Daniel Genkin, Koki Hamada, Dai Ikarashi, Ryo Kikuchi, Yehuda Lindell, and Ariel Nof
/// <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-96878-0_2.pdf>
///
/// In that paper, this functionality is called `F_product` and
/// an instantiation for Replciated Secret Sharing is provided in section 6.1 on page 27
///
/// To summarize the CHIKP protocol:
/// each helper computes `u_i+1 = (s_i + s_i+1) * (t_i + t_i+1) - s_i+1 * t_i+1`
/// It then randomizes this share with correlated randomness, and sends it to the helper to its right,
/// and receives `u_i` from the helper to its left.
/// Each helper then defines the pair `(u_i, u_i+1)` as its shares of the output.
///
/// (Note it is equivalent to compute `u_i+1 = s_i * t_i + s_i+1 * t_i + s_i * t_i+1`,
/// but this requires three multiplications instead of two. Assuming multiplying field elements is
/// significantly more costly (in CPU terms) than addition, this is less efficient to compute)
///
/// The key observation, that makes this protocol work, is that each helper can compute many `u_i+1` values
/// from many multiplications, sum them all together, randomize them with correlated randomness, and can
/// send this single field value to the next helper. The result will be a replicated secret sharing of the
/// dot-product of the two vectors.
///
/// ## Errors
/// Lots of things may go wrong here, from timeouts to bad output. They will be signalled
/// back via the error response
